# ghidra_example
A small CTF that I created for IST 4610 class in CSUSB.

### This only works for Linux sadly.

Download ghidra and have fun.

Find the flag labeled as: flag{example}

>*Note: Im aware that this is a super simple task to find the flag and its how its not worth using ghidra, its more of a proof of concept. I also added the c++ script if anyone wants to change it and compile it themselves. Will make more challenging CTFs to better grasp ghidra.*
