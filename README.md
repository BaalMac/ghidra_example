# CSUSB IST 4610 Ghidra CTF
A small CTF that I created for IST 4610 class to teach the basics of Ghidra. An open source reverse engineering program developed by the NSA.

### This only works for Linux and Windows.

Download ghidra_"Your choice of OS" and have fun.

Find the flag labeled as: flag{example}

>*Note: Im aware that this is a super simple task to find the flag and its how its not worth using ghidra, its more of a proof of concept on how to use Ghidra as a beginner. I also added the c++ script if anyone wants to change it and compile it themselves. Will make more challenging CTFs to better grasp Ghidra.*

Will upload guide to my blog soon... ^-^
